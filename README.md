# E_commerce_product_range_project-
This project is an E commerce product range project, its shows the analyze of an online store and analyze which products and product bundles are top-selling and which are not.

In this project I analyzed which products are the top-selling ones and which are not, I used the RFM analysis for this with K-Means clustring.
I also analyzed which product bundles are the top-selling and lifting each other, I used the Apriori algorithm for this.
